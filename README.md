### Heart Beat AnimationðŸ’“
**This project showcases an animated heartbeat on an HTML canvas using JavaScript.**


Description
```
This project is a web application that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create an animation of a beating heart on an HTML canvas.
The heart is drawn using parametric equations, and the animation is achieved by varying the scale factor of the heart over time.
Contents
```

> The project consists of the following files:


- index.html: The main HTML file containing the canvas and a reference to the JavaScript file.
 
- style.css: CSS file defining basic page styles, including layout and background color.
 
- heart.js: JavaScript file handling heart drawing and animation using the canvas 2D context.

**How to Use**
_Ensure all three files (index.html, style.css, and heart.js) are in the same folder on your computer._

`Open index.html in a modern web browser that supports HTML5 and JavaScript (such as Chrome, Firefox, Safari).
`

> The animated heart will begin pulsating inside the canvas on the web page.
